# Project-Exam-2
## This is for my last and final exam at my frontend course on Noroff.

### Goal
To take the skills learned over the last two years and take on an extensive project where the finished product should reflect the candidateâ€™s general development capabilities, in addition to visual and technical skills.
</br>
### Brief
A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end accommodation booking application.
</br>
There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues.
</br>
### Requirements
All API functionality is managed by an existing application. This project only covers the front-end application for the API.
</br>
### API
The API you are using for this project can be found under Holidaze in the Noroff API documentation.
